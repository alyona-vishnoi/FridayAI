## How it Started
FRIDAY AI was born out of a passion for exploring the potential of artificial intelligence and creating a personalized virtual assistant. As a fun and challenging project, it provided a fantastic opportunity to delve into NLU technologies and enhance my coding skills.

During the development of FRIDAY AI, I learned invaluable lessons in implementing NLU, handling voice recognition, and integrating various functionalities seamlessly. The project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Python, web APIs, and the principles of natural language processing.

## Future Plans
FRIDAY AI is just the beginning of an exciting journey. I plan to continue enhancing her capabilities by incorporating more sophisticated NLU algorithms and refining her responses. My goal is to create an intelligent and intuitive assistant that adapts to users' needs and preferences seamlessly.
